'''
In this game, the player is in a land full of dragons. 
The dragons all live in caves with their large piles of collected treasure. 
Some dragons are friendly and share their treasure. 
Other dragons are hungry and eat anyone who enters their cave. 
The player approaches two caves, one with a friendly dragon and the other with a hungry dragon, 
but doesnâ€™t know which dragon is in which cave. 
The player must choose between the two.
